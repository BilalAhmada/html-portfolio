    By the way i'm interested in astronomy alot more than in IT field.I have alot of knowledege about Stars,Black Holes,Galaxies,Quasars,Nebulas,Quantum Physics,Theories of Relativity etc and alot more objects lavitating in the universe.I collected all  the knowledege about universe by self study.I really want to get a chance to do work as an astronaut.

<h2>  Now the question is what i'm doing in IT? </h2>

    The answer is....... i have no choice other than this Computer field.I think may be i have interest in coding because i use to make phishing pages in my mobile phone through TERMUX haha and that really works.I got passwords of my friends by using phishing pages.
